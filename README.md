Open Source Client-Side Standalone Bitcoin File Generator

Send and receive bitcoins over email, dropbox, USB, etc.

moneypacket.org lets you store bitcoins into files, “money packets”, on your local computer.  These files contain "real bitcoins" and can be shared using conventional technologies or simply backed-up for safekeeping.  Money packets can be redeemed to an address of your choosing or to a new money packet, meaning recipients don’t need a bitcoin wallet to receive funds.  Open source, client-side, and no trusted third parties holding funds for you.

“Send bitcoins to Grandma over email.”
